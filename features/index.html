          The Hello Phone is undeniably at the top of the pyramid when it comes
          to performance. But being the supposedly best (or more justifiably the
          most-preferred one) Android device out there üòú. We guarantee that the
          Hello Phone will not disappoint you at any front.

      <h2>Camera</h2>

        <p>
          Standing true to our naming, the Hello Phone device has qualified to
          be the true leader of photography in the smartphone industry. This is
          because of our exceptional abilities when it comes to software-based
          processing and improvements in the cameras as well as the dedicated
          Pixel Visual Core chip.
        </p>

      <h2>Display</h2>

        />
        <p>
          Elegance is the way forward for the Hello Phone. Designed to be chic
          on the front and back, the modish appearance is sure to impress. The
          metal back features a brilliant gradient finish that shifts hues with
          the light to complete the look.

      <h2>Battery</h2>

          alt="man holding a smartphone with 100% battery"
        />
        <p>
          Charge the phone to 100%. Use it all day long and then it charges back
          to 100% in just around 60 minutes. WOW!
        </p>
      </section>
      <h2>Software</h2>
      <section>
        <img src="../assets/features/software.jpg" alt="a robo android icon" />
        <p>
          The Hello Phone runs the purest version of Android Pie 9.0 and can
          easily be classified as the most advanced phone to do so. Besides the
          benefit of a bloat-free and vanilla Android experience, you also get
          certain features before any other Android device, and this includes
          features such as real-time and automatic Google Lens usage from the
          camera app. Supposedly, the smartphone should also be updated to at
          least Android R (or the third iteration from Pie) before any other
          device.
